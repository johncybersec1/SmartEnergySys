# Smart Energy Saving System
Project Overview
The Smart Energy Saving System is an IoT-based solution designed to optimize energy consumption in smart homes or buildings. By intelligently managing devices like lights, AC, heaters, cameras, and windows, the system reduces energy waste while maintaining comfort and security.

## Features
Energy Monitoring: Tracks real-time energy usage of connected devices.  
Automated Control: Adjusts lights, AC, heaters, and windows based on predefined thresholds and real-time conditions.  
Cloud Integration: Stores energy data in the cloud for analysis and remote monitoring.  
Smart Decision-Making: Uses sensors and algorithms to prioritize device usage for efficiency.  
User Customization: Allows threshold and preference adjustments through a user-friendly interface.  

## How It Works
Data Collection: Sensors monitor environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, light, motion) and device energy consumption.  
Data Processing: The system processes collected data to determine optimal device operation.  

## Automated Actions:
Turns off lights when no motion is detected.  
Adjusts AC and heaters based on room temperature.  
Opens or closes windows based on air quality or humidity.  
Manages camera activity based on motion and occupancy.  
Cloud Storage: Sends processed data to the cloud for logging, analytics, and remote monitoring.  
Feedback Loop: Continuously updates device behavior based on changing conditions.  

## System Requirements
### Hardware:
Sensors: Temperature, humidity, motion, light, air quality.  
Actuators: Smart switches, motorized windows, and dimmers.  
Microcontroller: Arduino, ESP32, or Raspberry Pi.  

### Software:
Cloud Platform: AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.  
Development Tools: Python, Node.js, or similar for backend logic.  
Mobile or Web Interface (optional): For user interaction.  
Connectivity: Wi-Fi or Zigbee for IoT communication.  

## Usage Tips
Adjust Thresholds: Customize thresholds to match your energy-saving goals and comfort preferences.  
Regular Maintenance: Periodically check sensors and actuators for proper functionality.  
Analyze Data: Use cloud analytics to refine system performance and identify further energy-saving opportunities.  

## Future Improvements
Integration with renewable energy sources (e.g., solar panels).  
AI-driven learning for dynamic threshold adjustment.  
Expanded compatibility with smart home ecosystems like Alexa or Google Home.
